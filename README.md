## App Brainstorming (Step 4)


Uber 
Can pre-order rides days before you need it
Can order rides, food, and send packages all in one app
Has safety features and preference settings to prevent kidnapping and promote comfort

Apple Music
Gives notifications about when your favorite music artists drops 
Shows the lyrics to the songs
Gives you a yearly recap of your most listened to songs, artists, and albums 
I like the Color scheme & how the buttons are conveniently placed

iMessage
You can unsend messages & edit
It connects to different apps such as cash app, apple music, game pigeon 
You can record voice messages

I want to create an app that contributes to the limitation of procrastination of the user. I think that adding different goals and daily tasks would be beneficial and could be something that is very fun and innovative.

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The main challenge I faced was using Xcode for the first time. It wasn't hard to use but I had to get used to it since it was my first time.
